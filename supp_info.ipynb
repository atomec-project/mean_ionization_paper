    "In this section, we describe the average-atom model that we use and the equations that are solved. For a detailed derivation and discussion of the model, please see our earlier pre-print \\cite{callow2021firstprinciples}. As noted in the main text, the most important difference from this previous model is that we do not now distinguish between bound and free KS orbitals, but rather all orbitals follow from the same KS equations and boundary conditions. The second difference is that, in this paper, we solve the spin-unpolarized KS equations; in other words, the spatial spin-up and spin-down orbitals are assumed to be identical, $\\phi_i^\\uparrow(\\vec{r})=\\phi_i^\\downarrow(\\vec{r})$.\n",

    "The degree of convergence required depends on various factors, such as the error that the user is willing to tolerate and the property that is being computed. In AA models, there are already a number of quite serious approximations which create uncertainty in the results, so typically we can use more relaxed convergence criteria than a full DFT-MD simulation. The property we are interested in for the purposes of this paper is the MIS, which is sensitive to the energy eigenvalues and chemical potential but not the total energy. Furthermore, we aim to benchmark our results agaist experiments which of course have some uncertainty for measurements of the free electron density.\n",

Based on the above table, this indicates a reasonable choice is `ngrid=3000`. In theory, this number should be checked for each value of temperature and density calculated. In practise, it is reasonable to test it for a few select values in the temperature or density range spanned and interpolate to the other values.\n",

However, since we have the band-structure AA model at our disposal, we can use that to guide which orbitals belong in the conduction and valence bands.
