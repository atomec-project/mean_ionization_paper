    "# Average atom models: Theoretical background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we describe the average-atom model that we use and the equations that are solved. For a detailed derivation and discussion of the model, please see our earlier pre-print \\cite{callow2021firstprinciples}. As noted in the main text, the most important difference from this previous model is that we do not now distinguish between bound and free KS orbitals, but rather all orbitals follow from the same KS equations and boundary conditions. The second difference is that, in this paper, we solve the spin-unpolarized KS equations; in other words, the spatial spin-up and spin-down orbitals are assumed to be identical, $\\phi_i^\\uparrow(\\vec{r})=\\phi_i^\\downarrow(\\vec{r})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall first review the important aspects of our model; in the following sub-section, we explain in more detail the band-structure model of Massacrier *et al.* \\cite{massacrier_bands} which we have also implemented in atoMEC. As discussed in the main text, we solve the spherically symmetric Kohn--Sham (KS) equations for an atom at finite temperature, with appropriate boundary conditions imposed on the orbitals intended to mimic the effect of interactions from electrons and nuclei in neighbouring atoms. The spherically symmetric KS equations are given by\n",

    "In the above, at each step of the SCF (self-consistent field) cycle, the spherically symmetric KS equations are solved for the chosen boundary condition (Eq. (2) of the main paper). In atoMEC, we solve the KS equations on a logarithmic grid to give more weight to the points nearest the origin, i.e. $x=\\log(r)$. Furthermore, we make a transformation of the orbitals $P_{nl}(x) = X_{nl}(x)\\exp(x/2)$. Then the equations to be solve become:\n",

    "In atoMEC, we solve the KS equations using a matrix implementation of Numerov's algorithm as described in Ref. \\onlinecite{matrixnumerov}. This means we diagonalize the following equation:\n",

Instead, we use a sparse matrix diagonalization routine from the Scipy library \\cite{scipy}, which scales more efficiently and allows us to go to larger grid sizes (and hence better convergence).\n",

As seen above, this is controlled via the `scf_params` input parameter to the `CalcEnergy` function. This dictionary also accepts a `maxscf` key to terminate the SCF cycle after the requested number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the SCF cycle, various information is printed, such as the breakdown of the total free energy and the KS eigenvalues and their occupations. The printed ''Mean ionization state'' (MIS) output is calculated using the threshold method described in the main paper. We shall later see how to compute the MIS in atoMEC via the other methods described in the paper. The output of the `CalcEnergy` function is a dictionary containing information about the energy, density, potential and orbtials. For example, we can extract and plot the density from this output:"

    "* `lmax`: the maximum number of the angular quantum number $l$\n",

    "Furthermore, for the `bands` boundary condition, there is the additional dictionary parameter `band_params`. The important property within this is `nkpts` number of 'k' points, which is the number of states that are computed within all energy bands (spaced linearly in energy) in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence for the `nmax` and `lmax` paramaters can generally be chosen by eye, in other words by ensuring there are sufficient states such that the highest levels have (nearly) zero occoupations. Let us consider our Aluminium atom from earlier, but now we shall increase the temperature (so more orbitals are required)."

This is enabled by the `config.numcores` parameter. Setting `config.numcores=n` uses `n` cores; however, it is often easiest to set `config.numcores=-1` which uses all the available cores."

In AA models, there are already a number of quite serious approximations which create uncertainty in the results, so typically we can use more relaxed convergence criteria than a full DFT-MD simulation. The property we are interested in for the purposes of this paper is the MIS, which is sensitive to the energy eigenvalues and chemical potential but not the total energy. Furthermore, we aim to benchmark our results agaist experiments which of course have some uncertainty for measurements of the free electron density.\n",

Based on the above table, this indicates a reasonable choice is `ngrid=3000`. In theory, this number should be checked for each value of temperature and density calculated. In practise, it is reasonable to test it for a few select values in the temperature or density range spanned and interpolate to the other values.\n",

This is because, under these conditions, the $1s$ level is fully isolated from the neighbouring spheres and so is not part of an energy band."

However, the time taken is almost identical regardless of the number of $k$-points used. This is because the computationally dominant step is actually the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, which is required to find the limits of the band energies. Therefore we are free to choose a relatively large value of `nkpts` without much affect on the computational demands. Typically the default value of `nkpts=50` in atoMEC is a reasonable choice. "

Nevertheless, the figure shows strong qualitative agreeement with the equivalent Fig. 2 in Ref. \\onlinecite{Redmer_Kubo_Greenwood}; furthermore, the position and width of the band gap is in quantitative agreement. This indicates the band-structure AA model is a good approximation for the full DFT-MD simulation under the above conditions."

    "As was seen in the earlier examples, the MIS calculate via the threshold method is printed by default at the end of every SCF run anyway. It is also a property of the `staticKS.Density` object so can be accessed through that if desired. Let us again run a calculation for Aluminium at ambient conditions:"
