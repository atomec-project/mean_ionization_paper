In AA models, there are already a number of quite serious approximations which create uncertainty in the results, so typically we can use more relaxed convergence criteria than a full DFT-MD simulation. The property we are interested in for the purposes of this paper is the MIS, which is sensitive to the energy eigenvalues and chemical potential but not the total energy. Furthermore, we aim to benchmark our results agaist experiments which of course have some uncertainty for measurements of the free electron density.\n",

In practise, it is reasonable to test it for a few select values in the temperature or density range spanned and interpolate to the other values.\n",
