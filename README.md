# Improved calculations of mean ionization states with an average-atom model: supplementary information

This repository contains the supplementary information for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05863) "Improved calculations of mean ionization states with an average-atom model" [INSERT REF HERE].

The main file is the `supp_info.ipynb` file. This is a Jupyter notebook which contains some computational details about the methods presented in the paper, and all the code required to reproduce the results of this paper.

## Installation

The packages needed to run the notebook are listed in `requirements.txt`, and can be installed (for example) with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The notebook has been tested with Python 3.8.

## Data: direct download

There are a large number of SCF calculations in the notebook. It is not feasible to run these on a personal computer, an HPC system is required. Therefore the notebook is by default set up not to run these calculations, though the code is provided for those who want to. 

Instead, the SCF results can be downloaded from this [link](), and should be unpacked into the root directory of the repository. On a unix system you can run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
$ wget <insert RODARE link here>
$ tar -xvf SCF_results.tar
```

This will create a `results/` directory, which contains a separate `README.md` file detailing the structure of this directory.
