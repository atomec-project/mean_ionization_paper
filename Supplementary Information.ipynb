    "We see from the above that, for this example, the quantities of interest are very well converged already with `nkpts=20`. However, the time taken is almost identical regardless of the number of $k$-points used. This is because the computationally dominant step is actually the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, which is required to find the limits of the band energies. Therefore we are free to choose a relatively large value of `nkpts` without much affect on the computational demands. Typically the default value of `nkpts=50` in atoMEC is a reasonable choice. "
