The output of the `CalcEnergy` function is a dictionary containing information about the energy, density, potential and orbtials. For example, we can extract and plot the density from this output:"

This is enabled by the `config.numcores` parameter. Setting `config.numcores=n` uses `n` cores; however, it is often easiest to set `config.numcores=-1` which uses all the available cores."
